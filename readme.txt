### Personalize the AI Chatbot with Custom Knowledge:

One of the standout features of **MxChat** is the ability to fine-tune the AI’s responses by adding **personalized content** directly through the WordPress admin dashboard. This is achieved through **vector embeddings**, a powerful technique that allows the AI to reference specific information you provide.

Whether you want the chatbot to answer questions based on your company’s unique services, products, or content, you can easily submit this information manually or via your website's sitemap. By submitting custom knowledge, you guide the AI to understand and prioritize the most relevant data, ensuring that the responses are not only accurate but also highly contextual to your business or website.

- **Manual Content Submission**: Within the WordPress admin, you can manually add specific articles, FAQs, or any text that you want the AI to use as a reference. The plugin processes this content using vector embeddings, enhancing the chatbot's ability to deliver precise, context-aware answers.

- **Sitemap and URL Submission**: MxChat now supports both sitemap and individual URL submissions. By submitting your website’s sitemap, MxChat automatically extracts content from the URLs listed, adding it to the chatbot’s knowledge base. You can also manually submit specific URLs to ensure targeted content is included. This integration helps keep the AI well-informed about your site’s content, enhancing the overall user experience.

### GDPR Compliance & Multilingual Support:

- **Complianz Integration (Pro Feature)**: With the new [Complianz integration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM3wlkOgcZg), MxChat ensures GDPR compliance by only displaying the chatbot to users who have consented to marketing cookies. This helps website owners stay compliant with data privacy regulations, and is available as a **Pro feature** for enhanced privacy controls.

- **Customizable Privacy Policy Text**: To support multilingual websites and specific legal requirements, MxChat allows you to customize the privacy policy text displayed with the chatbot, ensuring that users are informed about data usage in a transparent and compliant manner.

These features make MxChat an ideal solution for businesses seeking multilingual support and GDPR compliance while delivering a seamless and personalized AI-driven chatbot experience.

### New in Version 1.2:

- **Popular Questions Buttons**: You can now add up to three frequently asked questions (FAQ-style buttons) directly to the chatbot interface. This feature allows users to click on popular questions, which the chatbot will automatically ask and respond to. The first question is free to use, while the second and third questions are part of the **Pro version**.

- **Inline Edit Button for Knowledge Database**: Managing your knowledge base is easier than ever with the new **Edit button**. Instead of deleting and re-entering entries in your knowledge database, you can now edit entries directly from the knowledge base interface. This streamlined workflow improves database management for both free and Pro users.

### New in Version 1.1.9:

- **Claude API Integration (Pro Feature)**: We are excited to announce the integration of **Claude models** from **Anthropic**! Pro users can now take advantage of advanced language models like **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** for intelligent, real-time interactions. This integration expands the model selection beyond OpenAI and X.AI, giving you access to Claude’s sophisticated language capabilities.
